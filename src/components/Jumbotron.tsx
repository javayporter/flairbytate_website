        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          I believe everyone deserves a taste of luxury, no matter their budget.
          What started as designing my own home as a single mom of two has grown
          into a passion for curating spaces that uplift, inspire, and reflect
          each personâ€™s unique lifestyle. With creativity, resourcefulness, and
          a love for beauty, I help clients turn houses into homes that feel
          both comfortable and luxe.
